   JI_CHEONG_CHEON_DESC:0 "Having defected from the Japanese Imperial Army in 1919, Ji-Cheong-cheon is well-versed in modern forms of warfare and is extremely popular amongst the right-wing of korean guerila fighters and partisans. His collaboration with Rhee Syngman, of whom many see as an american opportunist puppet, has hindered his ability to fully secure the support of less radical factions, although he is still respected despite his allegiances and has cemented his role in the Korean National Revolutionary Party"
   KOR_CHARACTER_KIM_IL_SUNG:0 "Kim Il-sung"
   KIM_IL_SUNG_DESC:0 "A merited guerilla leader and politician, Kim Il-sung is renowned within the independence movement for his contributions, though a devisive figure, due to his close allegiances with the comintern, which have alienated much of the anti-comintern left-wing partisans. Despite this, he has managed to rise up the ranks and become head of the Workers' Party of Korea."
